## Known Limitations & Assumptions

### Device Limitations
- **Voice Availability**: The number of available voices depends on the device's TTS engine and installed language packs
- **Language Support**: Not all languages may be supported on all devices
- **Voice Quality**: Voice quality and pronunciation may vary between devices and TTS engines

### Technical Limitations
- **Single Voice**: If only one voice is available for a language, voice switching won't work
- **Platform Differences**: TTS behavior may vary between Android and iOS
- **Network Dependency**: Some TTS engines may require internet connection for certain languages

### Assumptions
- **Default TTS Engine**: Uses the device's default TTS engine
- **Voice Indexing**: Assumes voices are indexed consistently across play sessions
- **Language Codes**: Uses standard locale codes (e.g., 'en-US', 'fr-FR')

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No voices found**
   - Check device TTS settings
   - Ensure language packs are installed
   - Try different languages

2. **Voice not switching**
   - Check voice count in the dropdown
   - Use "Reset Voice" button
   - Try different languages

3. **App not speaking**
   - Check device volume
   - Ensure TTS is enabled in device settings
   - Check console logs for errors

### Debug Information

The app provides detailed console logs for debugging:
- Available voices for each language
